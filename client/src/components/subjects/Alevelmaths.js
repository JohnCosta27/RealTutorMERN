						The only way you get better at maths is by doing maths.
						Our Maths lessons are question based, which means as the
						student learns new content we actively show them exam
						questions with topics they just learnt, this way the
						student can get accustomed to the type of questions as
						well as reinforcing their knowledge.
					</Typography>
					<br></br>
					<Typography variant="body2">
						We also make sure to constantly revise what we have done
						before, this will allow for reinforced learning to come
						into play which means the student will not forgot
						content, which so very often happens in colleges. This
						is possible due to our custom made software which tracks
						progress and can tell us exactly what the student knows.

				Masterâ€™s Degree in Physics with Mathematics. I have an
				A* in Maths, an A in Physics and a B in Further Maths,
				coupled with experience in tutoring Physics and Maths.
				Physics was unlocked as a passion of mine once I started
				my GCSE learning in Year 10. I would research topics far
				beyond the scope of the GCSE course. It lit a fire
				underneath me, a burning passion to grow my knowledge, a
				conquest in life that will never end. Mathematics
				naturally followed on from my passion in physics, for it
				is the language of the universe."
